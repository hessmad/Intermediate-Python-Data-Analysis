1. a) I do not think the bar chart is an effective tool for data visualization
as it is difficult to evaluate difference in the data and it gives an
over-simplification of our available data.
   b) I chose a line plot so I could show the changes in degree attainment for
   the different groups we were evaluating.  The line plot was the most
   effective at comparing different populations clearly.

2. There are a few limitations to our dataset.  First would be that it only
looks at individuals between 25 and 29 years old so it misses out on observing
later in life graduates or individuals who may be currently working towards a
degree.  Furthermore, there is a lot of missing data for different races in
earlier observations so the total calculated is likely very inaccurate for
the whole population.

3. There are definitely ethical issues present as far as trying to make
predications about the future. If used for such a purpose, this model 
could be used to assert that certain groups are less likely to complete school
than others. Such an assertion could be used to marginalize other populations.
This dataset fails to evaluate other factors affecting education attainment
which would be necessary to even begin to try to predict education attainment
of individuals in different groups.
